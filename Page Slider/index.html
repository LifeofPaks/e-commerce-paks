              very much." "We are here to add what we can to life, not to get
              what we can from life." "If you change the way you look at things,
              the things you look at change." "Perfection is not attainable. But
              if we chase perfection we can catch excellence."

              Believe you can and you're halfway there.
              To do the useful thing, to say the courageous thing, 
              to contemplate the beautiful thing: that is enough for one man's life."

              We pass through this world but once.Live out of your imagination, not your history.
              Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.'"

              "Life is a song - sing it. Life is a game - play it. 
              Life is a challenge - meet it. Life is a dream - realize it
               Life is a sacrifice - offer it. Life is love - enjoy.
              Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward. 
              If you want to fly, you have to give up what weighs you down."
